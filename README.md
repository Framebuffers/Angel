# Angel
_Kinda like a guardian angel above you, but for Godot_

# What does it do?
It's a third person camera based on [this camera by JeanKouss](https://github.com/JeanKouss/godot-third-person-camera), but ported to C#.

# Does it work?
No.

# Will it work?
Yes, someday. Bugs are on latest push.

# Why?
Cause I want a 100% C# codebase for something I'm doing, and this is quite an exercise to learn2code.
